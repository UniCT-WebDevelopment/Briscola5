# Bri5cola author *Ismaele Benbachir*

## The game

See: https://www.pagat.com/aceten/briscola_chiamata.html

## Getting Started

The code is written in nodejs: '10.13.0';

package manager npm: '6.4.1';

Tested on Linux 4.15.0-43-generic x86_64.

From git repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/UniCT-WebDevelopment/Briscola5 name`

Target directory is called 'name' (it can be omitted).
To start server:

`npm start`

You need to have a MySQL Database on port *8846*.
Server is running on port *80*. On linux you can run:
```
sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `readlink -f \`which node\``
```
to enable port 80.

Create first the database using the .sql file you find in the root directory.
If your configuration is the default MySQL configuration run
`$node start`
to start the server. If need any particular configuration, edit *server.js*  inside the server directory. (you have to change directory to project/server).
